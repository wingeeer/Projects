In this folder you can find some of the assignments I completed (for fun, not signed up for the course) for the course TDT4136 - Introduction to artificial intelligence:

"The subject starts with a description of problem solving methods by means of heuristic search. Therafter, various knowledge representation languages and inference methods for automatic problem solving. Representation in form of predicate logic, frames and semantic nets are treated, and connected to the main forms of reasoning - especially rule based reasoning. Furthermore, architectures that integrates various resoning methods, agent based architectures and architectures for interactive problem solving. Numerous applicaton examples are given to demonstrate the methods."

Assignment 3 covers an implementation of different graph traversal algorithms (A* search, BFS, Dijkstra) in order to navigate through different given boards.

Assignment 5 is an implementation of an algorithm to solve given sudoku boards. This is an example of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and uses AC-3 to make sure of arc-consistency and then backtracking to traverse the tree.
